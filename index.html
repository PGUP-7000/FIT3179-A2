      <h1>Fires in Australia</h1>
      <p class="heading-subtext">
        Bushfires in Australia are a widespread and regular occurrence that have contributed
         significantly to shaping the nature of the continent over millions of years. In addition to loss of life, homes, 
         properties, and livestock are destroyed potentially leaving people homeless, 
         traumatized, and without access to electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, to drinking water

      <h2>Map Of Fires in Australia</h2>
      <p>The below map provides an accurate representation of Fires in Australia caught by Satellite Imaging.
        I have tried to recreate the image of Australia from space as seen by one of these satellites if all fires were to
        burn at the same time. The darker spots represent brighter, more powerful fires, whereas the size of the spots indicate
        how widespread that fire was.

      <p>As we can see, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland
        and Western Australia are the only states where a high number of fires have been recorded.
        The nature of the fire depends somewhat on local topography. 
        Hilly/mountainous fires burn in areas which are usually densely forested.he land is less accessible and not conducive 
        to agriculture, thus many of these densely forested
         areas have been saved from deforestation and are protected by national, state and other parks.

      <h2>Fire Radiative Power(FRP)</h2>
      <p>The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the rate of radiant heat output from a fire. It has been
        demonstrated in small-scale experimental fires that the FRP of a fire is related to the rate at which fuel is
        being consumed. Fire Radiative Power is expressed in units of power, such as Watts (W).
